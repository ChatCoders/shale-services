# Xtheme IRC Services - VISION

Xtheme was inspired by the Atheme Development Group deciding to end 
future development on Atheme IRC Services.  

Our vision is to be a suitable successor to Atheme for IRC networks 
that ran Atheme.  We've added new features, fixed bugs and have more 
planned for the future.  Be sure to read NEWS.md for more specifics.  

XthemeOrg also provides the Services Web Interface (a Web Panel for  
Xtheme IRC Services and some atheme forks) which is also known as  
SWI.  

Xtheme desires to maintain compatibility with networks that ran 
Atheme, however in some cases this may change if it would actually 
benefit Xtheme development and networks running Xtheme.

If you have an idea for Xtheme, please feel free to open an issue 
on GitHub.  We're generally open to (good) ideas.  Bugs should also 
be reported as an issue on GitHub or seek support on IRC.
