Help for ZLINE:

ZLINE allows you to maintain network-wide IP bans.
Services will keep your ZLINES stored and allow for easy management.

Syntax: ZLINE ADD <IP> [!P|!T <minutes>] <reason>

If the !P token is specified the ZLINE will never expire (permanent).
If the !T token is specified expire time must follow, in minutes,
hours ("h"), days ("d") or weeks ("w").

Examples:
    /msg &nick& ZLINE ADD 127.0.0.1 !T 5 bar reason
    /msg &nick& ZLINE ADD 127.0.0.1 !P bar reason

The first example adds a 5 minute ZLINE/DLINE for "bar reason."

The second example is similar but adds the ZLINE permanently instead of
5 minutes.


Syntax: ZLINE DEL <IP|number>

If number is specified it correlates with the number on ZLINE LIST.
You may specify multiple numbers by separating with commas.
You may specify a range by using a colon.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& ZLINE DEL 127.0.0.1
    /msg &nick& ZLINE DEL 5
    /msg &nick& ZLINE DEL 1,2,5,10
    /msg &nick& ZLINE DEL 1:5,7,9:11

Syntax: ZLINE LIST [FULL]

If FULL is specified the ZLINE reasons will be shown.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& ZLINE LIST
    /msg &nick& ZLINE LIST FULL

Syntax: ZLINE LIST <IP>

Shows any ZLINEs or DLINEs matching the given IP, with reasons.

Syntax: ZLINE LIST <number>

Shows the given ZLINE, with reason.

Syntax: ZLINE SYNC

Sends all zlines or dlines to all servers. This can be useful in case
services will be down or do not see a user as matching a certain zline.
