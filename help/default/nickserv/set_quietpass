Help for SET QUIETPASS:

SET QUIETPASS prevents services from automatically
notifying you when another user tries to log in as
you without having the correct password. When set
to ON, Services will no longer send you messages of
this nature while you are logged in.

When you connect, Services tells you anyway the
number of such events that occurred since your last
successful login. This includes the time where you
were subsequently logged.

Syntax: SET QUIETPASS ON|OFF

Example:
    /msg &nick& SET QUIETPASS ON
