Help for SUPPORT:

Use of the SUPPORT command indicates that you
SUPPORT the Channel Registration for the 
channel you provide.  This command needs to 
be used by each Supporter listed in a Channel
Registration request.  (If you are used as a 
Supporter on a Channel, you will be notified 
via Memo and asked to either use the SUPPORT 
command or report that you do NOT support the 
Channel Registration request.)

Each Channel being registered must have 2 (two)
registered users who SUPPORT the channel being 
Registered, in order to be provided registration.

Syntax: SUPPORT #Channel

Examples:
    /msg &nick& SUPPORT #FunChat
