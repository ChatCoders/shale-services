Help for SUSPEND:

The SUSPEND command allows you to maintain channel
access suspension lists.  Suspended users will be
automatically deoped (if opped) and will be unable
to use their access or flags until the suspension
expires or is manually removed.

Syntax: SUSPEND <#channel> ADD <nickname> [!P|!T <minutes>] [reason]

If the !P token is specified, the SUSPENSION will never
expire (permanent). If the !T token is specified, expire
time must follow, in minutes, hours ("h"), days ("d")
or weeks ("w").

Syntax: SUSPEND <#channel> DEL <nickname>

This will remove a SUSPENSION on a user, giving 
them access to their flags.

* Information about a SUSPENSION can be requested
by performing WHY on a SUSPENDed user.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& SUSPEND #foo ADD bar you are annoying | private op info
    /msg &nick& SUSPEND #foo DEL bar
