Help for FSUSPEND:

The FSUSPEND command allows Services Operators to 
manipulate channel access suspension lists.  
Suspended users will be automatically deoped 
(if opped) and will be unable to use their access 
or flags until the suspension expires or is 
manually removed.  This can affect Founders as well!

Syntax: FSUSPEND <#channel> ADD <nickname> [!P|!T <minutes>] [reason]

If the !P token is specified, the SUSPENSION will never
expire (permanent). If the !T token is specified, expire
time must follow, in minutes, hours ("h"), days ("d")
or weeks ("w").

Syntax: FSUSPEND <#channel> DEL <nickname>

This will remove a SUSPENSION on a user, giving 
them access to their flags.

* Information about a SUSPENSION can be requested
by performing WHY on a SUSPENDed user.

Examples:
    /msg &nick& FSUSPEND #foo ADD bar you are annoying | private op info
    /msg &nick& FSUSPEND #foo DEL bar
