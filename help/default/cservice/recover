Help for RECOVER:

RECOVER allows you to regain control of your
channel in the event of a takeover.

Note: RECOVER may make the channel unusable by
general public! If there is no takeover 
emergency, instead, read

    /msg &nick& HELP OP

More precisely, in the case of RECOVER,
everyone will be deopped, limit and key will
be cleared, all bans matching you are removed, 
a ban exception matching you is added (in case
of bans &nick& can't see), the channel is set
invite-only and moderated and you are invited.

If you are on channel, you will be opped and
no ban exception will be added.

Syntax: RECOVER <#channel>

Example:
    /msg &nick& RECOVER #FunChat
